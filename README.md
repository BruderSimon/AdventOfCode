# AdventOfCode
This Repository contains my results to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) Puzzles.

They might not be the best solutions, as I am fairly new to doing this
and my main motivation is to learn a programming language better.

## Notice
My Solutaions take a text file with the input called "input.txt". I do
not provide inputs, as these are the property of [Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

# Lanugages
I started the 2024 AoC with plain C and try to use as few libraries as
possible (for me) to get used to plain C.

I know that a lot of people do these kind of tasks in python, because
it's faster and easier, however doing things the easiest way is not my
cup of tea (and it would contradict my main motivation).

The first solution will be written in C and if I have time I will
write them in other languages as well, here are some language I want
do (or at least try):
- ELisp (because I use Emacs as my main editor)
- Assembly
- COBOL
- Fortran

I know that these are quit unusual, however it is exciting for me
